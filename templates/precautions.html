                    You can’t prevent autoimmune and genetic forms of diabetes. But there are some steps you
                    can take to lower your risk for developing prediabetes, Type 2 diabetes and gestational
                    diabetes, including:
                </p>
                <ul class="ul_design">
                    <li class="mb-3">Eat a healthy diet, such as the Mediterranean diet.
                    </li>

                    <li class="mb-3">Get adequate sleep (typically 7 to 9 hours) and seek treatment for
                        sleep disorders.

                    as your genetics/family history, age and race. Know that Type 2 diabetes is a complex
                    condition that involves many contributing factors.

                    How is diabetes managed?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Diabetes is a complex condition, so its management involves several strategies. In
                    addition, diabetes affects everyone differently, so management plans are highly
                    individualized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The four main aspects of managing diabetes include:
                </p>

                <ul class="ul_design">
                    <li class="mb-3"><b>Blood sugar monitoring:</b> Monitoring your blood sugar (glucose) is
                        key to
                        determining how well your current treatment plan is working. It gives you
                        information on how to manage your diabetes on a daily — and sometimes even hourly —
                        basis. You can monitor your levels with frequent checks with a glucose meter and
                        finger stick and/or with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). You and your healthcare
                        provider will determine the best blood sugar range for you.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-3"><b>Oral diabetes medications:</b> Oral diabetes medications (taken by
                        mouth)
                        help manage blood sugar levels in people who have diabetes but still produce some
                        insulin — mainly people with Type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. People with
                        gestational diabetes may also need oral medication. There are several different
                        types. Metformin is the most common.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-3"><b>Insulin:</b> People with Type 1 diabetes need to inject synthetic
                        insulin
                        to live and manage diabetes. Some people with Type 2 diabetes also require insulin.
                        There are several different types of synthetic insulin. They each start to work at
                        different speeds and last in your body for different lengths of time. The four main
                        ways you can take insulin include injectable insulin with a syringe (shot), insulin
                        pens, insulin pumps and rapid-acting inhaled insulin.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-3"><b>Diet:</b> Meal planning and choosing a healthy diet for you are key
                        aspects
                        of diabetes management, as food greatly impacts blood sugar. If you take insulin,
                        counting carbs in the food and drinks you consume is a large part of management. The
                        amount of carbs you eat determines how much insulin you need at meals. Healthy
                        eating habits can also help you manage your weight and reduce your heart disease
                        risk.
                    </li>
                    <li class="mb-3"><b>Exercise:</b> Physical activity increases insulin sensitivity (and
                        helps
                        reduce insulin resistance), so regular exercise is an important part of management
                        for all people with diabetes.

            <div class="mx-4 mb-4 text_style">
                <h3 class="heart-text">How can I prevent heart disease?</h3>
                <p>Heart disease prevention isn’t possible for congenital (at birth) heart disease. But you can lower
                    your risk of other kinds of heart disease in these ways:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Maintain a Healthy Diet:</b> Eat a balanced diet that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
                    lean
                    proteins, and healthy fats. Limit the intake of saturated and trans fats, cholesterol, salt, and
                    added sugars. Choose foods that are low in sodium and high in fiber.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Exercise Regularly:</b> Engage in regular physical activity to improve cardiovascular health. Aim
                    for at
                    least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per
                    week. Incorporate activities that increase heart rate and strengthen muscles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Quit Smoking:</b> If you smoke, quitting is one of the most important steps you can take to
                    prevent
                    heart disease. Smoking damages blood vessels, increases the risk of blood clots, raises blood
                    pressure, and contributes to the development of plaque in arteries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Control Blood Pressure:</b> High blood pressure (hypertension) is a significant risk factor for
                    heart
                    disease. Monitor your blood pressure regularly and work with your healthcare provider to manage it
                    through lifestyle changes, medication, or a combination of both.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Regular Health Check-ups:</b> Schedule regular check-ups with your healthcare provider to assess
                    your
                    heart health, monitor blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant markers. Follow your
                    doctor's advice and take prescribed medications as directed.
                </p>
            </div>


            <div class="mx-4 mb-4 text_style">
                <h3 class="heart-text">What can I expect if I have heart disease?</h3>
                <p>Medications and/or procedures can help people who have various types of heart disease. Most types of
                    heart disease are easier to treat if you get an early diagnosis instead of waiting for symptoms to
                    get worse. Many people can live full lives when they follow their healthcare team’s treatment plan.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you have heart disease, the specific symptoms and outcomes can vary depending on the type and
                    severity of the condition. Here are some general expectations for individuals with heart disease:
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Chest Discomfort:</b> Chest discomfort or angina is a common symptom experienced by individuals with
                    heart disease. It may feel like pressure, tightness, or a squeezing sensation in the chest. The
                    discomfort may also radiate to the arms, shoulders, neck, jaw, or back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Shortness of Breath:</b> Heart disease can lead to shortness of breath, especially during physical
                    activity or exertion. The reduced pumping capacity of the heart can result in decreased oxygen
                    supply to the body, leading to breathlessness and a feeling of fatigue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Fatigue and Weakness:</b> Individuals with heart disease often experience fatigue and weakness, even
                    with minimal physical exertion. The heart's reduced ability to pump blood efficiently can result in
                    reduced oxygen delivery to the muscles, causing feelings of tiredness and weakness.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="mx-4 mb-4 text_style">
                <h3 class="heart-text">How do I take care of myself?</h3>
                <p>If you have coronary artery disease (the most common kind of heart disease), you can improve your
                    health by making changes to your daily life. This may include reducing how much salt and saturated
                    fat you eat and increasing how much you exercise. In addition, a provider may recommend taking
                    medicine to lower your cholesterol and/or blood pressure.

                <p>There’s no proven way to prevent PCOS, but you can take small steps to reduce your
                    symptoms. For example, eating nutritious foods, exercising regularly and managing a
                    healthy weight for your body can help you avoid the effects of PCOS.

                    increasing your risk for certain pregnancy complications, but many people with PCOS do
                    get pregnant on their own. Your healthcare provider will work with you to develop a
